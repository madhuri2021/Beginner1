                        <h5><b> Fennec Foxes <b></h5>
                       <li><b> The fennec is the smallest species of canid. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, desert environments. Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey moving underground. It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds. 
                               The fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity. Its main predators are the African varieties of eagle owl, jackals, and other large mammals. Families of fennecs dig out dens in the sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as 120 m2 (1,292 sq ft) and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. </b><br>
                        
                        <br> <h5><b> Glacus Atlanticus </b></h5>
                       <li><b> Glaucus atlanticus is a species of small, blue sea slug. it occurs throughout the world's oceans, in temperate and tropical waters.</li></b>

                        <br><h5><b> Okapi </b></h5>
                       <li><b> Okapi is an artiodactyl mammal native to the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. Although the okapi bears striped markings reminiscent of zebras, it is most closely related to the giraffe. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores. </li></b>
