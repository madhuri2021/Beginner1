                          This book is a good read for everyone that is looking for some motivation through form of fictional short stories and real life experiences. 
                          Paulo Coelho , a renknown writer for the beautiful language which he uses in his books and enchants the reader taking them into the world of the book their reading , this is one of his best work i suppose. <br> <br>
                      Here are few handpicked quotes by me which have magically embedded thmeselves into my mind. Its worth your time to have a look by yourself , yup. <br> <br>

               1) Sometimes, we are so attached to our way of life that we turn down wonderful opportunities simply because we don't know what to do with it. <br> <br>

		2) It is part of the human nature always to judge others very severely and,when the wind turns against us,always to find an excuse for our own misdeeds,or to blame someone else for our mistakes. <br> <br>
       
              3) I am always amazed that so many people are concerned with wanting to be what they are not;What is the point of making yourself look ridiculous? You don't always have to pretend to be strong,there is no need to prove all the time that everything is going well,you shouldn't be concerned about what other people are thinking.Cry if you need to,it's good to cry out all your tears,because only then you will be able to smile again... <br> <br>
            
                4) When we can do nothing else, we can still love, without expecting any reward or change or gratitude.<br> <br>

              5) This is the present moment. Learn how to gobble it up without fear or guilt. <br> <br>
